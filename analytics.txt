What should be specifically represented in these graphs is the data we 
collected on humidity and temperature that was recorded in separate
intervals on a daily basis. Why we came down to this final decision was...

Python supports numerous data visualisation librarbies. In the end, we 
decided to narrow it down to selected two libraries in Plotly and Seaborn
for our project. We narrowed it down to these libraries specifically because
of easy to understand and detailed documentation (i.e. cheat sheets we found
on the respective websites), easier learning curves to use both in coding,
and better visuals (i.e. easy to view and understand for other viewers
of the graphs).
